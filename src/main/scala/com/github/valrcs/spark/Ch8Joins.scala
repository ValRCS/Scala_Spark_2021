    //Join Types
  //Whereas the join expression determines whether two rows should join, the join type determines
  //what should be in the result set. There are a variety of different join types available in Spark for
  //you to use:
  //Inner joins (keep rows with keys that exist in the left and right datasets)
  //Outer joins (keep rows with keys in either the left or right datasets)
  //Left outer joins (keep rows with keys in the left dataset)
  //Right outer joins (keep rows with keys in the right dataset)
  //Left semi joins (keep the rows in the left, and only the left, dataset where the key
  //appears in the right dataset)
  //Left anti joins (keep the rows in the left, and only the left, dataset where they do not
  //appear in the right dataset)
  //Natural joins (perform a join by implicitly matching the columns between the two
  //datasets with the same names)
  //Cross (or Cartesian) joins (match every row in the left dataset with every row in the
  //right dataset)

  //Inner Joins
  //Inner joins evaluate the keys in both of the DataFrames or tables and include (and join together)
  //only the rows that evaluate to true. In the following example, we join the graduateProgram
  //DataFrame with the person DataFrame to create a new DataFrame:
  //// in Scala
  val joinExpression = person.col("graduate_program") === graduateProgram.col("id")


  //Keys that do not exist in both DataFrames will not show in the resulting DataFrame. For
  //example, the following expression would result in ZERO values in the resulting DataFrame:
  //// in Scala
  //val wrongJoinExpression = person.col("name") === graduateProgram.col("school")

  //so we will add to person table description of the graduate program
  person.join(graduateProgram, joinExpression).show(false)
  //same with sql syntax - need tempViews for both tables!
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM person
              |JOIN graduateProgram
              |ON person.graduate_program = graduateProgram.id""".stripMargin)

//  We can also specify this explicitly by passing in a third parameter, the joinType:
  // in Scala
  var joinType = "inner"
  person.join(graduateProgram, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)


  //OUTER Joins
  //Outer joins evaluate the keys in both of the DataFrames or tables and includes (and joins
  //together) the rows that evaluate to true or false. If there is no equivalent row in either the left or
  //right DataFrame, Spark will insert null:

  //so persons with non existant graduate programs will show up
  //also graduate programs which no on is using will show up here
  joinType = "outer"
  person.join(graduateProgram, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)
  //same as above
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM person FULL OUTER JOIN graduateProgram
              |ON graduate_program = graduateProgram.id""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)


  //less common joins

//  Left Outer Joins
//  Left outer joins evaluate the keys in both of the DataFrames or tables and includes all rows from
//    the left DataFrame as well as any rows in the right DataFrame that have a match in the left
//  DataFrame. If there is no equivalent row in the right DataFrame, Spark will insert null
  //so left side of row has to exist, but right side of row might not

  joinType = "left_outer"
  //all graduate programs even without finishers should show here
  graduateProgram.join(person, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)
  //Homer should show up below
  person.join(graduateProgram, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)

//  Right Outer Joins
//  Right outer joins evaluate the keys in both of the DataFrames or tables and includes all rows
//  from the right DataFrame as well as any rows in the left DataFrame that have a match in the right
//  DataFrame. If there is no equivalent row in the left DataFrame, Spark will insert null:

  joinType = "right_outer"
  //so here Homer will not exist since he has no valid school id,
  // schools will show up even if no one goes there
  person.join(graduateProgram, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)

  //now Homer will show up, but schools will not
  graduateProgram.join(person, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)
  //same as above
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM graduateProgram RIGHT OUTER JOIN person
              |ON person.graduate_program = graduateProgram.id""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)


  //left semi join - you do not get any values from the right side - sort of like a filter
  //Left Semi Joins
  //Semi joins are a bit of a departure from the other joins. They do not actually include any values
  //from the right DataFrame. They only compare values to see if the value exists in the second
  //DataFrame. If the value does exist, those rows will be kept in the result, even if there are
  //duplicate keys in the left DataFrame. Think of left semi joins as filters on a DataFrame, as
  //opposed to the function of a conventional join:

  joinType = "left_semi"
  graduateProgram.join(person, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)

  // in Scala
  val gradProgram2 = graduateProgram.union(Seq(
    (0, "Masters", "Duplicated Row", "Duplicated School")).toDF())
  gradProgram2.createOrReplaceTempView("gradProgram2")

  //so if there are multiple matches on the id, then all of those rows will be shown
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM gradProgram2
              |LEFT SEMI JOIN person
              |ON gradProgram2.id = person.graduate_program""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)

  //Left Anti Joins
  //Left anti joins are the opposite of left semi joins. Like left semi joins, they do not actually
  //include any values from the right DataFrame. They only compare values to see if the value exists
  //in the second DataFrame. However, rather than keeping the values that exist in the second
  //DataFrame, they keep only the values that do not have a corresponding key in the second
  //DataFrame. Think of anti joins as a NOT IN SQL-style filter:
  joinType = "left_anti" //so we will see those rows from the left table which did not have a join

  graduateProgram.join(person, joinExpression, joinType).show(false)
  //same in SQL
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM graduateProgram
              |LEFT ANTI JOIN person
              |ON graduateProgram.id = person.graduate_program""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)

  //WARNING
  //There exists a Natural join which is handy if you have same column names in different tables
  //otherwise avoid since it will join on the wrong columns!!!
  //Implicit is always dangerous! The following query will give us incorrect results because the two
  //DataFrames/tables share a column name (id), but it means different things in the datasets. You should
  //always use this join with caution
  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM graduateProgram NATURAL JOIN person""")
    .show(false) //so this will be nonsense join because it will join on ids

  //finally there is a Cartesean join meaning it will match everything without checking any match condition so lots of rows
  //so if you have 2 1000 row tables you will get 1 million row Carteasean join table
  //Cross (Cartesian) Joins
  //The last of our joins are cross-joins or cartesian products. Cross-joins in simplest terms are inner
  //joins that do not specify a predicate. Cross joins will join every single row in the left DataFrame
  //to ever single row in the right DataFrame. This will cause an absolute explosion in the number of
  //rows contained in the resulting DataFrame. If you have 1,000 rows in each DataFrame, the cross-
  //join of these will result in 1,000,000 (1,000 x 1,000) rows. For this reason, you must very
  //explicitly state that you want a cross-join by using the cross join keyword

  joinType = "cross"
  graduateProgram.join(person, joinExpression, joinType).show(false) //so 5 persons * 5 school programs = 25

  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM graduateProgram
              |CROSS JOIN person
              |ON graduateProgram.id = person.graduate_program""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)
  //so SPARK protected us from our crazyness, we have to explicitly call out that we want a cross join

  person.crossJoin(graduateProgram).show(25,false) //so now we get our 25 rows

  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM graduateProgram CROSS JOIN person""").show(25, false)

  //Joins on Complex Types
  //Even though this might seem like a challenge, itâ€™s actually not. Any expression is a valid join
  //expression, assuming that it returns a Boolean:

  person
    .withColumnRenamed("id", "personId")
    .join(sparkStatus, expr("array_contains(spark_status, id)"))
    .show(false)

  spark.sql("""SELECT * FROM
              |(select id as personId, name, graduate_program, spark_status FROM person)
              |INNER JOIN sparkStatus ON array_contains(spark_status, id)""".stripMargin)
    .show(false)

  joinType = "inner"
  person
    .withColumnRenamed("id", "personId")
    .join(sparkStatus, expr("array_contains(spark_status, id)"))
    .join(graduateProgram, joinExpression, joinType)
    .show(false)
  //also we have spark status
