  //TODO read part-01.json
  //TODO get schema
  //TODO count how many walking events there were for user i
  //TODO find out how far user i has walked :)
  //TODO super simple would be find starting and ending location

  //For those who are comfortable
  //TODO even better would be if you can calculate distance between each walking event
  //above would probably involve Window functios
  // TODO this would involve sorting by Creation Time
